# AML-For-Face-Recognition
Face recognition attack theory.


The high performance of systems based on deep neural networks has attracted many applications in object recognition and facial recognition. However, this power also has disadvantages. Networks are highly susceptible to attack and therefore tend to be unreliable and lack robustness. Such visually imperceptible adversary attacks can have a misleading effect on facial recognition and can cause system performance degradation. To defend against adversary attacks, sophisticated detection and mitigation approaches are used.

In this thesis we will present some of the most used attack, defense and mitigation strategies for facial recognition. Furthermore, a toolbox for the implementation of these strategies will be presented and the experimental results will be reported that attest to the effectiveness of the techniques proposed in the toolbox.
